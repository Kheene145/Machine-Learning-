# :rocket: Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 

## :mag: Overview
- Credit card fraud is a significant challenge in the financial sector. In this project, I built a fraud detection detection model using machine learning classify transactions as fraudelent or non-fraudulent.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source:[Kaggle- Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/fraud-detection)
  

- size: 284,807 trasactions
  
  
- Features: 30 numerical features + 1 target column
  
  
- Target Variable
    - 0: Legitimate transaction
    - 1: Fraudulent transaction
      
 
## 🛠️  Tech Stack
✔️ Python (pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib seaborn)


✔️ Machine Learning (LogisticRegression, Random Forest)


✔️ Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
 ✔️ Checked for missing values

 
✔️ Visualized fraud and non-fraud transactions


  ✔️ Examined featured distributions


 ✔️ Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE



## 📈 Machine Learning Model Used



## Key Takeaways

- The dataset contains 284,807 transactions, out of which only 492 transactions were identified as fraudulent.

  
- The fraudulent transactions account for approximately 0.173% of the total dataset, highlighting a highly imbalanced dataset.

  
- To improve model performance, we extracted 492 legitimate transactions to create a balanced subset for initial predictions.


- To fully address the class imbalance, we applied undersampling technique
